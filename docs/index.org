#+title: shrt_link backend documentation

This is the backend for the *shrt_link* project, a link shortener created for learning purposes.

Some of the technologies used are:
- Express
- PostgreSQL
- JSON Web Token
- TypeORM
- Redis (planned for future implementation)

The project is still in development and has room to mature, but for now, it is functioning quite well.
